### About
- A simple terminal guided bot that takes an item you want to purchase, adds to cart, and automatically pays and checksout
- In the future I hope to make an automation program that runs much faster along with the capability to avoid bot detection software and autofill reCaptcha fields.
- To use the bot make sure selenium is installed and to create a config.py in the directory that includes a key object containing the following:
    - First / Last name
    - Address, City, Postal Code, Phone Number
    - Credit Card Number, Name on Credit Card, Credit Card Expiry Date, and Credit Card CVV

### Software
- **Python3** to create the script. I picked Python over Java for simplicity sake
- **Selenium** for python to run the automated script and give access to browser control via driver.
